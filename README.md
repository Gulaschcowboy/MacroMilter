# MacroMilter
## Help wanted
I need some code review and help to make this milter better! If you find some bugs or the code is "creepy" -> feel free to contribute :)
## Abstract
This python based milter (mail-filter) checks an incoming mail for MS 200x Office attachments (doc, xls, ppt). If a MS Office file is attached to the mail it will be scanned for suspicious VBA macro code. After the milter parsed the attachment a kind of risk level will be defined for that document. If the risk level reaches a defined value â€“ the mail will be rejected to the sender.

*The repo is optimized for Visual Studio*
## Features
* Parsing VBA macros for suspicious code and function calls
* Uses the milter interface at postfix and sendmail
* Easy to implement
* Not based on virus heuristics (high detection rate)
* Only reject if a threshold is reached
* Whitelisting
* Creates a hashtable for allready scanned files (prevents rescans)
* Runns at the pre-queue at postfix

## Installation (Ubuntu with upstart)
1. download the oletools (https://bitbucket.org/decalage/oletools) and pymilter (https://pythonhosted.org/milter/) packages
2. step through the following bash. In some cases, you need to edit paths or install some missing dependencies!
```bash
# create files and folders
mkdir /etc/macromilter
mkdir /etc/macromilter/log
# only needed for a chroot env
mkdir /var/spool/postfix/etc/milter
touch /etc/macromilter/whitelist.list

# setup upstart config
cp MacroMilter.conf /etc/init/
initctl reload-configuration

# install macromilter dependencies
apt-get update
apt-get install python2.7 python2.7-dev libmilter-dev libmilter1.0.1

# install oletools
tar -zxvf oletools-0.41.tar.gz
cd oletools-0.41
python setup.py install

# install pymilter --> maybe you need some addtional dependencies - see doc
tar -zxvf pymilter-1.0.tar.gz
cd pymilter-1.0
python setup.py install

cp macromilter.py /etc/macromilter/

# set chown for postfix
chown postfix:postfix -R /etc/macromilter
# only needed if you run the milter at chroot an with a linux-socket
chown postfix:postfix -R /var/spool/postfix/etc/milter 

# start and check
service MacroMilter start
tail /var/log/syslog
```
